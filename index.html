<b style-"font-family:georgia;font-size:80%;"> The Transcript (rough translation from Russian; interview is with an ex-Russian soldier, who met Alexey);
some of it had to be cut, due to entire lack of sense</b>
<p style-"font-family:georgia;font-size:80%;">
Today marks 100 years from the day the legendary pilot of the Soviet Union,
Alexey Maresyev, was born. He made his first combat departure in 1941, and 
already on April 4, he had taken down multiple aircraft. After a crash, he 
crawled to the frontal line; subsequently, both of his legs were amputated, 
however he was resilient not to quit. He began a new page of his life with 
prosthetics in forty-three. He returned to aviation and, with the strength 
of his spirit, he trained other people.  I remember meeting with the pilot.
Our fellow countryman Hero of Russia Alexey was wounded and lost both legs; 
this was, in his mind, an important sacrifice;  his physical ability muted, 
while his mentality strengthened.  While he was in the hospital, I stopped 
by and saw him, in his wheelchair. He said the will of fate awards a prick
the highest award; do not be arrogant, don't prioritize yourself; when you 
have the opportunity, help people.  Help them using what opportunities you
are given. Helping people will be become easier. Petrovich to the last day 
participated in helping apartments knocked out;  he helped halt the tyrant 
long ago, which gave hope that you can live on normal full life.
