<b style-"font-family:georgia;font-size:80%;"> The Transcript (rough translation from Russian; interview is with an ex-Russian soldier, who met Alexey)</b>
<p style-"font-family:georgia;font-size:80%;">
Today marks 100 years from the day the legendary pilot of the Soviet Union,
Alexey Maresyev, was born. He made his first combat departure he made in
1941, and already on April 4, he had taken down many aircraft. He crawled to 
the front line; subsequently, both of his legs were amputated, however he 
did not give up. He began a new portion of his life with prosthetics in 
forty-three. Hereturned to aviation, and by the power of his spirit he
trained other people. I remember meeting with the pilot. Our fellow 
countryman Hero of Russia Alexey and some other heroes chagin in 1998
his antiterror group ambushed chagin was wounded and lost both legs 
at this moment to him helped Alexei Morrissey in which visited Yaroslavl 
in the hospital when I stopped the court put in a wheelchair there already
contract through what stood my paladin and accepted he said prick the will 
of fate awarded the highest award don't be arrogant don't go to yourself 
if you have opportunity helps people help using what you have opportunities 
helping people will be easier otherwise petrovich to the last day engaged 
helping apartments knocked out helped the tyrant long ago gave hope that
you can live on normal full life.
